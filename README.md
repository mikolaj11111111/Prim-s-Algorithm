# Prim's Algorithm - Minimum Spanning Tree

## Description
Finds the minimum spanning tree of a weighted graph using Prim's algorithm. Starts from a user-specified vertex and grows the tree by adding minimum weight edges.

## Features
- Greedy algorithm approach
- Color-based vertex tracking
- Edge weight minimization
- Interactive starting vertex selection

## Usage
Requires "data.txt" with 8x8 adjacency matrix. User selects starting vertex (1-8), and algorithm builds MST step by step.
